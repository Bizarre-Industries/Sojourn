# never-guess.sh — PreToolUse hook fired on Bash + WebFetch. Doesn't
# block. Injects an additionalContext reminder when the proposed action
# involves an external tool whose behavior may have drifted since the
# LLM's training cutoff, or matches a "I think this works" pattern.
#
# Per CLAUDE.md: LLM training data drifts. Compilation passing is not
# correctness. This hook is a nudge, not a wall — Claude still acts,
# but with a reminder to verify upstream before relying on the action.
#
# Payload (stdin): JSON with tool_name, tool_input. Output (stdout):
# JSON with hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext when a reminder is
# warranted, otherwise nothing.
